2. Title: HotSpot: Common JVM Crash Causes and Solutions (Fairoz Matte, Oracle)

Details: Although many crashes are caused by issues that are internal to the JVM itself, there are a surprising number of other causes of JVM crashes that developers and system administrators can identify and resolve on their own.

This session explores the most common causes of JVM crashes and how to identify them and get back up and running as soon as possible.
